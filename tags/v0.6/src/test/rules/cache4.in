hintlet_cache_control.js

# This file tests the rule in hintlet_cache_control.js:
#   'Favicons should have an expiration at least one month in the future'
# Be careful to only trigger the specific rule you're interested in, 
# since there are several rules defined in this file.

# Note that I haven't seen any favico records in the wild.  I don't think normal
# instrumentation of the network layer catches them since they are not directly
# referenced by the web page.  The rule and tests make an assumption that 
# the records look like regular resource responses.

# Input Record 1
# Expected: HINTLET RECORD
# No expires header and caching turned on
