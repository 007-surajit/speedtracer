/**
 * Rule to find static content served from a domain that sets cookies. From Page Speed, "Static
 * content, such as images, JS and CSS files, don't need to be accompanied by cookies, as there is
 * no user interaction with these resources. You can decrease request latency by serving static
 * resources from a domain that doesn't serve cookies. This technique is especially useful for pages
 * referencing large volumes of rarely cached static content, such as frequently changing image
 * thumbnails, or infrequently accessed image archives. We recommend this technique for any page
 * that serves more than 5 static resources. (For pages that serve fewer resources than this, it's
 * not worth the cost of setting up an extra domain.)"
