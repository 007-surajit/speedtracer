== Why am I still getting the warning "no data recieved"?  I already added the --enable-extensions-timeline-api flag.==

First, you must be sure your version of chrome is recent enough (version 4.0.249.30 or later should word)

Close all instances of chrome before running the shortcut you 
created. (If you are using Microsoft Windows, check your task manager to be sure you dont have a zombie chrome 
process hanging around). If even one of them is still up, it will fork a 
chrome window from the existing instance of the chrome browser.
