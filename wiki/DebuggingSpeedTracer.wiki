#summary Debugging Speed Tracer

This page describes some strategies for debugging the Speed Tracer UI.

== Prerequisites ==
 * [http://wiki.eclipse.org/Older_Versions_Of_Eclipse Eclipse 3.6]
 * [http://code.google.com/eclipse/docs/getting_started.html Google Plugin for Eclipse]
 * [BuildingSpeedTracer Get the Speed Tracer code]

= Setting up Eclipse =

== Import the Projects ==
In this part we'll assume that you have checked out Speed Tracer at `~/src/speedtracer`.

1. In Eclipse, we first need to setup a GWT SDK for the Speed Tracer project. Go to *Eclipse > Preferences...* (Mac) or *Window > Settings*. Then navigate to *Google > Google Web Toolkit*.

2. Choose *Add...*. Browse to `~/src/speedtracer/src/third_party/gwt` for your "Installation Directory" and use `SPEEDTRACER` for your "Display name".

3. We now need to import the projects, select `File > Import...`

4. Select *Existing Projects into Workspace* then press *`Next`*

5. Select root directory and Browse to `~/src/speedtracer/src`. There are 3 projects and they should all be checked. Hit *Finish*
 _speedtracer-api_ - Some APIs that we moved to a separate project.
 _speedtracer-stools_ - Some tools needed as part of the build.
 _speedtracer-ui_ - The code for the Speed Tracer client.

6. You should now have all the Speed Tracer source available to you in Eclipse without any reported errors.
